# Haus

## Description

Haus is a mock property rental application. My family owns Airbnb properties, however they aren't to thrilled with some of the requirments the Airbnb app has. In this app Ive created functionality for users to create an account, as well as loging into the account. Im using sessions to allow the user to stay logged in.

## Requirements

Ruby 2.7.4
NodeJS (v16), and npm
Heroku CLI
Postgresql

## Functions

When you first load into Haus, you're going to want to create a new user for yourself.
after creating the user you can "login" as that created user.
once signed in the user has the ability to leave reviews on properties they've visited.

## Precautions

Passwords are being handled with Bycrpt.
